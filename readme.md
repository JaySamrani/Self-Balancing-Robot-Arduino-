The two-wheel cart will be made of two wheels, a platform, and a motor on each wheel.The platform will be made of a lightweight material,
such as plywood. The motors will be connected to the platform using a frame. The sensors that will be used are an accelerometer and a gyroscope.
These sensors will be used to measure the tilt of the cart. The controllers that will be used are a PID controller and a motor controller. The PID
controller will be used to calculate the speed of the motors, and the motor controller will be used to control the speed of the motors.
The code will read the data from the sensors, calculate the speed of the motors, and send the speed commands to the motor controller. The code will sleep for a millisecond before repeating the loop.

The sensors will need to be calibrated before the cart can be used. The PID controller will need to be tuned to the specific cart and sensors. The motor controller will need to be compatible with the motors that are being used. The code will need to be tested to ensure that it is working properly.
